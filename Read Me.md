### AirBnB reservation price according to AirBnB official website information:


##### Question 1: What are the main accommodations / features that have affect reservation price the most? I will be looking at things such as size of room, location, host experiences etc. and how they affect the reservation price rates.

Analysis showed that bathrooms, bedrooms, accommodates, and beds, current month, and hosts listing count effect price.

##### Question 2 : Is there any seasonality in availability for AirBnb ? How does time of the year correlate with availability? What is the busiest time of the year in Boston & Seattle?

I found that Seattle and Boston have different peak pricing and availability during different times of the year.

##### Question 3: What is the monthly average price/night for the city? 

Seattle has per/night prices in July &  August and Boston in September and October.
